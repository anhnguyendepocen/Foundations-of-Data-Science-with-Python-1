My ideas:

Average numbers, 2 ways -- extend to calculate expected value

Fourier idea: determine frequency content of signal

Determining net velocity of an airplane given information on velocity from engines plus wind speed velocity

Determine the angle between two vectors

Calculation of work done through using a force to move an object

Representation of a linear function in any number of dimensions

Word2Vec - represent a word as a vector, where similar worlds will have vectors that are close to each other

FROM QUORA

Below are some uses:

Finding angle between 2 vectors or 2 straight lines, angle between 2 intersecting planes, angle between plane and straight line.
Finding projection of a vector onto another unit vector. Applications include finding projection of a force onto a specified axis.
Checking whether 2 vectors are perpendicular.
Finding work done by a force.
Multiplication of matrices in linear algebra involve taking dot product of the row in left matrix with column in right matrix.
